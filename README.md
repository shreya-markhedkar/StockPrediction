# Stock Prediction
A simple project comparing different machin learning models to see which fits best. </br>
The proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes
pre-processing of the stock market dataset, utilization of multiple feature engineering
techniques, combined with a customized deep learning-based system for stock market price
trend prediction. This project is a survey on the application of neural networks in forecasting
stock market prices. Using Decision Tree Regression and Linear Regression
algorithms in this project to predict the stock price values. After comparing the accuracy of
these algorithms, conclusion is that Decision Tree Regression model
performs better than the Linear Regression model for this project.

If the relationship between dependent & independent variable is well approximated by a
linear model, linear regression will outperform tree-based model.
If there is a high non-linearity & complex relationship between dependent & independent
variables, a tree model will outperform a classical regression method.
Decision tree models are even simpler to interpret than linear regression.
